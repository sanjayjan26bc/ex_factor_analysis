Updates to Action Items:
Action Items for 12/06/2024:

// *** REQUIREMENT #1 ***//
#1: Above all else, prioritize how edits and selections are passed to the streamlit application! 
Below code assigns the grid_response to session state. 

# Extract the grid response from the return value
grid_response_stag = return_value.get('grid_response', {})

# Store the grid response in session state
st.session_state['grid_response_stag'] = grid_response_stag

The session state values are shown before AgGrid rendering and after rendering.

// *** REQUIREMENT #2 ***///
#2: Programmatically rendering which parts of the pivot are expanded and programmatically sensing which part of the pivot are expanded from aggrid.
Above is not needed.

// *** REQUIREMENT #3 ***///
Do everything assuming flat dataframe (no pivot, no grouping)
This is done.

// *** REQUIREMENT #4 ***//
Hover over any cell should tooltip the value in the corresponding comment column, but preceded by indication that original value had been changed since last save.
// *** REQUIREMENT #5 ***//
Render with a multi index column header

Both above requirements can be done with tooltipValueGetter, children option.
When GridOptionsBuilder is used, the above options are not working. I am looking into this.

{
   'headerName': "Hover For Tooltip",
   'headerTooltip': "Column Groups can have Tooltips also",
   'children': [
     {
       'field': "sport",
       'tooltipValueGetter': JsCode("""function(){return "Tooltip text about Sport should go here"}"""),
       'headerTooltip': "Tooltip for Sport Column Header",
     },


// *** REQUIREMENT #6 ***//
Selecting any cell should tooltip the value of the corresponding comment column

This is added to the Upstream column. When Upstream value is clicked, corresponding comments are shown.

// *** REQUIREMENT #7 ***//
Double clicking a value cell should allow editing.
This is added to Prod. Sol. column. Double clicking allows editing.

// *** REQUIREMENT #8 ***//
All edited cells not saved yet are formatted differently (maybe a corner token, different background color, something), this includes related aggregates
An edit should trigger an event (both the location and value change)

Above requirement - Work in progress.

// *** REQUIREMENT #9 ***//
Fix Panes so that multiple BU columns can be scrolled to the right but left hand factors are still visible
This has been done using below code.
builder.configure_column('Factor L1', pinned='left')

// *** REQUIREMENT #10 ***//
Alternating rows are shaded for easy reading
This is done. Odd number rows - no color. Even number rows - light blue.


In addition below changes are also done.
Sort option at column header level removed.
Filter added only to Prod. Sol. and Upstream columns.
Pagination is enabled.
